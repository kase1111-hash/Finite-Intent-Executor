I want my music to be available on all major streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, YouTube Music — all of them. A 70/30 split favoring the estate is fair. Non-exclusive licenses only, so no single platform gets a monopoly on my work.
The Midnight Waves album is my most personal work. It should be licensed widely so people can discover it. Streaming is the future of music distribution and I want to be part of that future even after I'm gone.
I've always believed in open source and digital rights. The tools we build to protect creative freedom matter more than any single piece of content. I want my estate to fund projects that advance these values.
Fund open-source projects that work on digital rights, privacy tools, and creative commons infrastructure. Keep individual grants small — no more than five thousand dollars per project — so the money reaches many teams rather than concentrating in one place.
My personal website at alexchen.dev has my blog, music catalog, and project portfolio. Keep it running for ten years after my death so people can still find my work. After that, archive everything to IPFS and let the domain go.
Archive my website to IPFS after the maintenance period ends. A static snapshot is fine. The important thing is that the content remains accessible on the decentralized web permanently.
All my intellectual property — music, code, writing, everything — should enter the public domain after the twenty-year sunset period. Creative Commons Zero, no restrictions. Knowledge wants to be free.
I do not want my estate or any executor acting on my behalf to engage in any political activity whatsoever. No campaign donations, no lobbying, no political advocacy. My legacy is creative, not political.
Revenue from streaming royalties should be collected and used to fund the open-source grants I described. The music funds the mission. Distribute streaming revenue to digital rights organizations that align with my values.
I started contributing to open source in college and never stopped. The Digital Freedom Foundation, the Creative Commons technical team, and the Privacy Tools Collective are organizations whose work I deeply respect and have supported while alive.
My code contributions are on GitHub under the MIT license. After sunset, everything transitions to CC0. But during the twenty-year execution period, maintain the MIT license and keep accepting pull requests from the community.
Never sell exclusive rights to my music. The whole point is broad access. If someone offers an exclusive deal, no matter how lucrative, the answer is no. Non-exclusive licensing is a core principle, not a negotiation starting point.
